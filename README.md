This probably only works on linux.

# Compile
    make

# Usage
    server <port> <dir>

I use the linux kernel .clang-format which can be found [here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/.clang-format).

The cat images I use for the HTTP responses can be found [here](https://http.cat).

I have yet to make full use of the resources put forward by them, however, [this](https://github.com/AmyShackles/Web-Server-in-C) repo has been of great help to me.
